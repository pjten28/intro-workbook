  <section> <!--Is section appropriate here? Could I just "div" out the entirety of the document, or is that bad programming etiquette?-->

    <h2>I have lots of interests. Here are just a few of those:</h2>

    <ul> <!--I would center align the text of this piece, except for the fact that the bullet points of the unordered list stay left-aligned, which drives me crazy.-->

      <li>Sports (spectating or playing)</li>

      <li>Music (live or otherwise)</li>

      <li>Travel (<em>almost</em> anywhere and everywhere)</li>

      <li>Venture and startups</li>

    </ul>

  <section> <!--How do I constrain the width of this block of text? I don't want it to span the entire width of the webpage.-->

    <h3>But we can dive into this a little more.</h3>

    <p>Sports-wise, I very much like to watch and play football. That's number one. But I'll play most any sport. On the other hand, I neither watch nor "play" NASCAR, so there's that.</p>

    <p>Life is better with some sort of beat to it--hence why I enjoy music. One can generally find me listening to some mix of rock and electronic. At this moment, Radiohead is dominating the space in between my headphones.</p>

    <p>I like being able to just pick up and go. It's really cool to me to know that if I wanted to, I could leave my office right now and be in a city on the other side of the country within the span of several hours. A preferred destination of mine includes Chicago. Also, any place with mountains. But I always appreciate a change of scenery to break up any routines.</p>

    <p>But what do I actually <em>do</em>? I currently work for Notley Ventures, an early stage venture and social impact investing firm based here in Austin. Why? I love learning about building new companies, new products, new ideas. I want to be someone that helps bring about the future, who can look back years from now and say Hey, I was a part of this.</p>
